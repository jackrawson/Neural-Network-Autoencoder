# Neural-Network-Autoencoder

The following solution aims to develop a machine learning solution which jointly trains two MLPs (an encoder and a decoder) to autoencode a family of functions and fit a dataset to one of these curves.

The autoencoder (encoder) will use linear layers to fit a feature representation. The output of the encoder will be put into the decoder to produce the models prediction using the feature representation and a given set of points.
